        <p><strong>Taxation in Medieval Society (1066-1300)</strong></p>
        <p>After the Norman Conquest of 1066, England developed one of the most sophisticated tax systems in medieval Europe. The feudal structure created multiple forms of taxation:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-3">
          <li><strong>Tallage:</strong> Arbitrary taxes imposed by lords on their tenants and on towns</li>
          <li><strong>Scutage:</strong> "Shield money" paid by knights to avoid military service</li>
          <li><strong>Customs Duties:</strong> Taxes on imported and exported goods</li>
          <li><strong>Aids:</strong> Special payments required on particular occasions (knighting the lord's son, marriage of his daughter)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The collection of taxes often created tension between peasants and nobility. Tax rebellions were not uncommon, with the most famous being the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 (occurring much later than your current scenario).</p>
        
        <p>King Henry III (ruling in 1242) frequently requested special taxes to fund wars against France and to maintain English territories in Gascony. These taxes were particularly burdensome because many nobles questioned the value of these continental campaigns.</p>

        <p><strong>The Renaissance in Florence (1400-1550)</strong></p>
        <p>Florence in the early 16th century was at the heart of the Renaissance, a period of remarkable cultural and intellectual transformation that spread throughout Europe:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-3">
          <li><strong>Humanism:</strong> A renewed focus on classical learning and human potential</li>
          <li><strong>Patronage:</strong> Wealthy families like the Medici funded artists and scholars</li>
          <li><strong>Artistic Innovation:</strong> Development of perspective, realism, and new techniques</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific Inquiry:</strong> Growing interest in observation and experimentation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Leonardo da Vinci represented the ideal "Renaissance man" - accomplished in multiple fields including painting, anatomy, engineering, and mathematics. His workshop would have been filled with experiments, sketches, and unfinished masterpieces.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli was writing "The Prince" (published 1532), developing revolutionary ideas about political power and leadership that would influence centuries of political thought.</p>

        <p><strong>Industrial Transformation (1760-1850)</strong></p>
        <p>The Industrial Revolution marked one of the most significant transitions in human history, beginning in Britain before spreading globally:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-3">
          <li><strong>Mechanization:</strong> Machines powered by water and steam replaced human labor</li>
          <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Rapid growth of cities as workers migrated from rural areas</li>
          <li><strong>Social Change:</strong> Emergence of a working class with new challenges and identities</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Revolution:</strong> Shift from agricultural to manufacturing economy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By 1845, London had become the world's largest city, with about 2.4 million inhabitants. Factory conditions were often dangerous, with long hours, child labor, and few safety regulations. The Factory Acts of the 1830s and 1840s began to address these issues, limiting children's working hours and setting minimal safety standards.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, technological innovations like the power loom and steam engine were transforming not just how goods were produced, but the fundamental structure of society itself.</p>

          <li><strong>Public Fear:</strong> Widespread preparation for possible nuclear attack</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>President Kennedy's administration discovered Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba on October 16, 1962. After considering a military strike, Kennedy chose a naval quarantine of Cuba while negotiating with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev through both public and back channels.</p>
        
        <p>For ordinary Americans, the crisis brought the abstract concept of nuclear war into shocking clarity. Many prepared fallout shelters or made evacuation plans, while children practiced "duck and cover" drills in schools.</p>
